# Kodi Shadertoy Visualization-Upgraded
Modifications of the individual shaders

I thought the original list of shaders were a little old fashioned and not sophisticared enough - they felt very 1990's. I used more modern looking shaders. I swapped the code of each individual shader file to use new code. I copied and/or slightly tweaked shader codes from the Shadertoy web site. 
In addition, with the help of Grok AI, we created a script/service that cycles the shaders every 5 minutes. This way there is no fear of screen burn-in. The way to do this is, in the screensaver's settings, select Random as your screensaver. You must also install the cycler addon. 

Copy both folders:

     screensaver.shadertoy
	 service.shadertoy.cycler 
	 
To your Kodi's /addons folder. 
Go to Kodi > Addons > Look & Feel > Screensaver and ENABLE the screensaver addon.
Go to Kodi > Addons > Services > and ENABLE the service addon.

Reboot and set your Screensaver to this.
