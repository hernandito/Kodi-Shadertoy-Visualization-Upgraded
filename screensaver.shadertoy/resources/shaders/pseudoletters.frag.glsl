	Pseudo CJKV Characters
	----------------------

	Combining random vertical and horizontal line segments to vaguely form 
	pseudo digitized script logograms used in various parts of Asia. From 
	834144373's perpective, it will look like a bunch of meaningless random 
	lines strung together by an illiterate Westerner. :D

	Fabrice Neyret recently posted a trimmed down version of Otavio Good's
	"Runes" example, and it reminded me of a pseudo Chinese character
	version I'd seen around in a few places. This particular image was
	modelled from memory off an image I came across on a Tumblr blog called 
    "Experiments In Processing" run by Jerome Herr. The link is below, for 
	anyone interested.

	As you can see, it's just some random horizontal and vertical lines. 
	This should have been a very simple exercise -- Render 16 horizontal 
	segments and 16 vertical segments in a random fashion, and you're done. 
	Couldn't be easier... unless you have the logic of a drunk squirrel, and 
	spend ages not realizing that four lines bound three cells and not four. :D

	Anyway, to a Westerner like myself, it gives the impression of digitized
	Chinese characters for about 2 seconds, before the brain starts to sense
	that something's amiss. At that point, the characters take on a pseudo
	alien appearance, which is vaguely interesting in its own right. Someone
	with more expertise might be able to apply some heuristics to make it
	look more one way or the other, but this was just a quick diversion, so I
	wouldn't take it too seriously. :)

	I'll put together a fancier example later, but for now, I just wanted to 
	show a proof of concept. By the way, if you didn't require rounded lines, 
	you could push this out in a couple of tweets or less.
